## Gameplay Structure

### Start of Stage

- Select a Character (each with unique towers and a starting deck)
    
- Place **5 Core Towers** anywhere on the available map space (permanent for the entire stage)
    
- Towers initially have **no upgrades**
    

### Encounter Flow

Each Stage consists of:

- **3-5 Regular Encounters** (each encounter ~5-10 enemy waves)
    
- **1 Boss Encounter** (longer, ~20 waves + Boss)
    

### Pre-Encounter Setup

Before each encounter begins:

- Players draw a full hand from their Deck.
    
- Enemy "intent" for the encounter is clearly indicated (e.g., enemy types, wave count, special abilities).
    
- Players **strategically play their cards**:
    
    - **Temporary Tower Cards**: Towers that last only for this encounter.
        
    - **Power Cards**: Special effects (e.g., traps on paths, tower buffs, slowing enemies).
        
- Players **cannot play cards during the encounter itself**, reinforcing thoughtful setup and strategic depth.
    

### During Encounter

- Towers automatically defend against enemy waves.
    
- Players watch the results of their strategic placements.
    

### Post-Encounter Rewards

After successfully completing an encounter:

- **Tower Upgrade**: Choose one of the Core Towers to permanently upgrade (e.g., increased range, fire rate, splash damage, slowing effect).
    
- **Card Rewards**: Choose 1 new Power or Temporary Tower card from 3 randomly presented options, refining and strengthening the deck.
    

### Boss Encounter

After 3-5 regular encounters, players face a Boss Encounter:

- ~20 challenging waves plus a powerful boss unit.
    
- Boss clearly telegraphs abilities and intent, allowing strategic preparation.
    

**Boss Rewards**:

- **Relic**: Powerful, permanent passive effect (e.g., all towers deal bonus damage to slowed enemies, or towers regenerate health after waves).
    
- **Special Card**: Unique, potent card (e.g., powerful global effects, legendary temporary towers).

- **Spiked Road**: Damages enemies who walk over it during the encounter.
    
- **Frenzy**: One tower has doubled attack speed for this encounter.
    
- **Ice Patch**: Slows enemies significantly for this encounter.
    

### Example Temporary Tower Cards

- **Sniper Nest**: Extremely high damage, very slow rate of fire, lasts one encounter.
    
- **Tesla Coil**: Chains lightning between enemies, moderate damage, lasts one encounter.

## Progression & Replayability

- Each character provides a distinctly different playstyle.
    
- Deckbuilding and tower upgrades create unique strategic depth.
    
- Enemy intents encourage thoughtful tactical decision-making.
    
- Boss fights and relic rewards enhance replayability and satisfaction.
    

This structure maintains the satisfaction and progressive depth of tower defense while integrating the strategic nuance of deckbuilding roguelites.
